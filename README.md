# Clipboard landing page

![Design preview for the Clipboard landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking this project.


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can also contribute to this project. So if you've got something you'd like to modify, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs the best judgment is employed for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing all necessary info, such as color palette and fonts.



**Have fun contributing to this project and unless you're just looking around, have fun still** ðŸš€
